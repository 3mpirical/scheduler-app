MAIN_FEATURES_______________________________________________________________________
* To have a calendar searchable by month in which events can be recorded.
* To create events on a given day, and allow them to be dragged to other dates.
* To have a weekly view vs a monthly calendar option.
    ^Display side by side? or alternatively?
* To search Events by name, past, future, or both.
* To authenticate for specific users and their own personal calendars.
* To provide push notifications when events are nearing.
    ^and configure when you would like said notifications.

***** A simple and intuitive user experience is top priority; more !=== better *****



CONSIDERED_FEATURES_________________________________________________________________
* Decide if you want this to be a general planner, or specific to some domain
    ^(think planning projects, like planning books, or project management)

* On project management, consider creating a timeline which you can enter dates and have them be populated to your calendar. The project timeline itself will be the main source for management. Is it easier interface for planning than manually entering into the calendar..?
    ^If we wanted to go this route, then it may be worthwhile to create a project application where we create the timeline and enter project details via files and directory.



PLANNED_IMPLEMENTATIONS_____________________________________________________________
//  1) Redo user interface for calendar.
    Make the 42 squares hard coded, then select as nodeList, then append date information to that list as needed.
    *this will allow you to customize the interface better and index the square numbers on the calendar rather than referencing them only by their dates.
/////complete

//2) Add left/right (or up and down?) buttons to shift back and forth between
    months, then alter javascript to reflect user input. Make sure to create
    appropriate state variables for the selected month.
/////complete

//3) Format and style the heading properly so that it displays the entire month,
    day, year, and day of the week.
    ^note that currently when you select a day that is within a previous
    month or next month, the current day changes but not the month.
    So the heading becomes inaccurate compared to the selected box.
/////complete

//4) Create partials for the header and the footer. It won't be a full
    application yet, but it should look like a legit website to some extent.
/////complete
///----> redone to optimize for mobile use/layout

//5) Plan the schema and model for events.
/////complete

//6) Display Events on calendar.
/////complete

//7) Refactor code base, particularly calendar events for JS,
    and modularize all scss.
/////complete

//8) Remove zoom-in on increment/decrement buttons
/////complete

//9) Make the Event Pane fill the remaining screen space, regardless
    of the size of that space. (Flexbox)
//complete

//10) Deploy to heroku with Mlab added.
/////complete

//?) Add listeners to increment/decrement calendar when swiped left or right.
/////complete

//11) Hard code the "New Event," pane into hbs, and make it functional.
/////complete

**************| for now, just create the button which toggles, and when we create
**************| the view which gives us the "index of daily events," we will add
**************| the extra features to make sure the user won't enter information
**************| into inputs when the are not full screen.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//12) Use javascript to create a button on the top of the sidebar which will toggle the event pane up and down the screen. The problem we are having with data input is that the keyboard reduces the view height, which causes the event pane (which gets bigger/smaller according to the view height) to be erased from the screen. We need a method wherein the event pane is always toggled to cover the full screen when creating an event or updating one.
    ^^^Once an event is created or updated, we should ideally go back to the indexOfDailyEvents screen on the event pane, and reduce the screen to it's smaller size.
    ^^One problem with the above approach is that the user may decide to make the screen smaller again, in which case, the keyboard will still cover your inputs
    ^^^If we do this as a javascript add/remove of a class instead of a checkbox hack, we can account for the user minifying the screen by adding a separate event listener for form submission and button toggling, both of which will minify the screen, but the button toggling will check an event-pane__header. If the event pane showed a "create," or "update," view, then the view would next become "daily index of events," but if the header displayed another view (monthly index of events) then the event pane would be minified and unchanged.


continuous with 12) Work on the indexOfDailyEvents Event Pane in Javascript. This pane should be on the screen when we select a new day (or on the screen when the app loads, consider how the current day is our initial selected day);

13) Refactor code, both css and javascript, before you go any further. Make a list of small improvements/bugs to fix when time becomes available.

?) Modify Schema for color property, and display on calendar/Event Pane with a color-class.

?) Build in user authentication: routes, pages for login, appropriate
    hbs conditionals to display proper screens.

?) Make the application a PWA, so that it can fill the entire screen size without browser url issues. Don't worry about caching and webworkers just yet.
